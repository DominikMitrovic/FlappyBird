# FlappyBird Application

This simple game is a clone of "legendary" Flappy Bird mobile game. Application was written in C# (windows forms) and IronPython. The "game" part of the application is coded in C# and highscore table that is shown after the game finishes and player enters his/her's name is programmed in IronPython (extern script). IronPython module "Pickle" was used to easily export and import needed data to separate file. In current version there are no known bugs.
